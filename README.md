## Hi there, strangersðŸ‘‹

At the moment, I'm mostly using the github ideas for my README, but as soon as I get more ideas to present myself, I will add my changes to here.

Check my projects in my repositories. They are mostly academic and personal projects at the moment, but soon will be more professional projects as well. I just have to get a job/internship that challenges me to create some projects of my own.

Going now to the GitHub ideas for my README:
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on Dell Technologies (BCC site, on Eldorado do Sul, Brazil) as a Sales Channel Intern, but I intend to migrate for a more!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development in the Odin Project website, with focus on Ruby and Ruby On Rails, learning how to properly use (standard) Linux and continuing my frozen studies of Python and Data Analyses!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on many project I bumped into, as soon as them can give me some knowledge or can help me with the development of new and old skills!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help especially with the Linux OS at the moment.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 00141247@ufrgs.br or gabriel.otorres@inf.ufrgs.br
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love mythologies (Greek, Nordic and Egyptian for example) and curiosities and believe in the hidden potencial of the human being. All of this interests match with some of my favorite books, movies, series and videogames, listed under:
  - God of War (all of them);
  - Rick Riordan's books;
  - Dune Saga (the books especially);
  - Assassin's Creed;
